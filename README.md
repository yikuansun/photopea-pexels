# Pexels for Photopea

Find free, high quality photos for your edits, without ever leaving Photopea.

## Installation

On Photopea, go to **Window -> Plugins** and search for Pexels. Once installed, the Pexels icon will appear in the sidebar at the right of the window.

A complete guide to installing Photopea plugins can be found on the [Lunal Graphics blog](https://lunalgraphics.com/blog/2).

## Usage

By default, the plugin will display 50 photos curated by the Pexels staff. Show more photos by scrolling to the bottom and pressing **Show More**. To add a photo to your document, click on its thumbnail, select a size, and press **Add to Document**.

To search for photos, type a topic into the searchbar at the top of the plugin window. Search by pressing `Enter`, or by clicking away from the searchbar.

To view a photo on Pexels, click on the thumbnail, then click on the photo itself.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! I have only two conditions:

1. If you just want to change the aesthetic of the plugin, make your suggestion in [Issues](https://github.com/yikuansun/photopea-pexels/issues) rather than making a Pull Request.
2. If you want to make a change which compromises or removes an existing feature, ask me in [Issues](https://github.com/yikuansun/photopea-pexels/issues) before making a Pull Request.
3. Make sure you continue to adhere to the [Pexels API guidelines](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/?language=javascript#guidelines).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks so much to Pexels for providing the API!
